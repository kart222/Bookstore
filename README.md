Full-Stack Project incoroporating:
1) web scraping using requests, bs4, and Selenium. Scraped metadata such as price, number of pages, and ISBN values for 55 books on the NYT bestsellers list. Select values were then moved into a .csv file
2) MySQL workbench. Used mysql-connector-python to insert values from .csv file into a MySQL database.
3) GraphQL. Wrote GraphQL code in Javascript to create different query types, extracting relevant information about books in the database.
4) ApolloClient. Used ApolloClient to create a frontend framework that uses the existing GraphQL queries.
